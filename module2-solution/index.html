<h1> Our Menu </h1>

<div id="container1">
<p id="t1">Chicken</p>

<p>A taste of true Southern tradition with four hand-breaded pieces of bone-in chicken, using our special recipe seasoning, then fried 'til golden and crispy. We pair it with honey for drizzling. </p>
</div>

<div id="container2">
<p id="t2">Beef</p>
<p>Your last bite is just as good as your first. Our perfected broiling method and seasoning techniques ensure each cut of USDA Prime beef we serve arrives cooked to perfection and sizzling on a 500° plate—just the way you like it. </p>
</div>

<div id="container3">
<p id="t3">Sushi</p>
<p>Signature sushi rolls, traditional nigiri, and Japanese-inspired plates to share. We showcase a full cocktail program as well as a exciting saké selection. </p>
